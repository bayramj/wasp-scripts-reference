Tool GetObject
Tool to gather tile coordinates. Simply hover the tile you want the coordinate of and click with the mouse middle button. You can record several tiles at once into an array by click several tiles in a row. The Tile or TileArray will be printed everytime you add a tile.

To reset the array press space bar for a couple of seconds, maybe even a couple of times because Simba is bad at registering user key presses.

Once the message “Array cleared.” shows up you can start again.
